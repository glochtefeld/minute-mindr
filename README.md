# Minute-Mindr
Minute-Mindr is a cross-platform progressive web app that allows users to schedule out blocks in their week for user defined purposes. If your life is roughly cyclical about the week and you'd like to intentionally carve out time to work on larger projects in your spare time, consider Minute-Mindr.

## Using the site
### With an account
If you would like to take advantage of the cross-platform syncing capability of Minute-Mindr, sign up for an account at [minutemindr.io](https://minutemindr.io). Browsing to the site with a mobile browser will let you install the progressive version of the app. 

### Without an account
If you'd prefer to keep your data out of the cloud, that's fair. An account isn't needed to use the site and export a helpful schedule graphic for your week or upload a previously built schedule.

Why any of these? No strong reasons. Anyway, I like to make sure that things are in appropriate containers, so node-modules and virtualenv ahoy!
